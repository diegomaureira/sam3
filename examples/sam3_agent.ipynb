      "<think> State that there are 3 available masks in the image (the purple, green, and orange masks). Since there are exactly two images in the context, you will follow the Scenario 2 instructions:\n",
      "1. Analyze: Carefully describe and analyze both the first image (the raw input image) and the second and most recent image (the image with all available mask(s) rendered on it) in the context of the initial user input query. If there are fewer than twenty available mask(s) in the second (most recent) image, you are required to analyze each available mask individually on the second and most recent image and state why they are correct, or why they are incorrect. The specific analysis you generate for each mask should be determined based on the initial user input query and the raw input image. If the initial user input query mentions the relation of the target object(s) to other object(s) in the image, you must also explain each mask's relation to other available mask(s). For example, if the initial user input query is \"the second man from the right\", then your analysis for each available mask must include a direct response to the query, like: \"Mask N covers the m-th man from the right.\"\n",
      "2. Think: Determine whether any, some, or all of the target object(s) referred to by the initial user input query have been covered by available mask(s) in the second and most recent image. Re-examine the raw input image carefully to determine whether there are still missing target object(s) in the image that match or answer the initial user query but are not yet covered by any segmentation mask. After carefully examining the raw input image, if you find that all of the target object(s) referred to by the initial user query have been covered and that there are no more missing target(s), you must write: \"After carefully examining the raw input image, I am certain that all the target(s) referred to by the initial user query have been covered by available mask(s).\"\n",
      "3. Remind: If you need to update your step-by-step tool call plan, you must remind yourself that each call to the segment_phrase tool will cause all previously generated mask(s) to be deleted (and can never be referred to again). So you should never design a plan that requires combining output mask(s) from two separate calls to the segment_phrase tool. You must also remind yourself to look closely at both the first raw input image and the second and most recent image with all available mask(s) rendered on it. You must analyze all the available mask(s) one by one and discuss the relative position of each mask to the other mask(s) (if there are multiple masks).\n",
      "4. Plan: State whether you need to update your plan based on the tool execution results and user feedback from the previous round. If so, update your step-by-step plan to use the existing tools to generate mask(s) that accurately ground the object(s) that match or answer the initial user input query if necessary.\n",
